        <h3 id="drawing-shapes">Drawing Shapes</h3>
        <p>After effects gives you very basic drawing tools for creating ellipses, polygon, etc.</p>
        <img src="img/kb/kb-fig-1.png">

        <h3 id="changing-attributes">Changing Attributes</h3>
        <p>Attributes for a given layer can be found in a set of dropdown menus under the layer name in the timeline panel.</p>
        <img src="img/kb/kb-fig-2.png">

        <h3 id="importing-illustrator">Importing Files</h3>
        <p>You can drag images and video directly from your desktop to your project pane, and from there you can drag them to your composition canvas.</p>
        <img src="img/kb/project-pane.png">
        <h4>Importing Illustrator Drawings</h4>
        <p>Illustrator was created to make complex vector drawings, so it’s the better place to start if you want to create a vector drawing more elaborate than basic shapes. Remember that you can convert illustrator layers to after effects shapes, but the conversion isn’t always perfect. Custom brushes will import as shapes rather than lines, for example.</p>
        <h4>Importing Photoshop Documents</h4>
        <p>Importing from photoshop is quite similar to illustrator, with each layer appearing in a composition. Best if you are working in pixels (imagine you are animating a photo collage, for example) rather than vector shapes.</p>

        <h3 id="timeline">The Timeline</h3>
        <p>The panel on the left is an outline of all your layers, with their attributes in the
        The panel to the right shows the times where keyframes (a location on a timeline which marks the beginning or end of a transition) are placed.</p>
        <img src="img/kb/kb-fig-3.png">

        <h3 id="animating-attributes">Animating Attributes</h3>
        <p>Attributes can be animated with keyframes by clicking the stopwatch icon and changing the values at different points in time.</p>
        <img src="img/kb/kb-fig-4.png">

        <h3 id="expressions">Expressions</h3>
        <p>Attributes can also be animated with expressions. You can add an expression to an attribute by option-clicking the stopwatch icon and typing it into the resulting text box. Expression are based on the javascript.</p>
        <p>some expressions we've used:</p>
        <p><code>loopOut();</code> This expression loops through the keyframes on a given attribute.</p>
        <p><code>wiggle(a,b)</code> This expression randomly assigns values to an attribute with 'a' being the frequency of the values and 'b' the amplitude.</p>

        <h3 id="masks">Masks</h3>
        <img src="img/kb/kb-fig-5.gif">
        <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1m_pol5V3eLixtnwO5C5jcgnFORyqNHpt">After effects file</a> containing examples of masking techniques</p>

        <h3 id="parent-link">Parent and link layers</h3>
        <p>Setting a layer to be another layer’s parent means that as you transform the parent layer those transforms will also be applied to the child/link layer. Imagine you have a bunch of complex motions applied to several layers. Now imagine you want that group of layers to move left and scale. Instead of trying to update the movements of those individual layers, simply make another layer their parent and move and scale that layer.</p>

        <h3 id="pre-compose">Nesting compositions and pre-compose</h3>
        <p>Layers in after effects can be things like live shapes or they can be compositions. You can move a group of layers, including all their animated attributes into a new composition by selecting pre-compose in the menu bar. Often it is easier to group a set of elements into a single self-contained composition and create animations there then try and maintain all your animated layers in a single comp. example: let’s say you are animating a character. You might choose to put the head into its own composition allowing you to animate facial features.</p>

        <h3 id="time-remapping">Time remapping compositions</h3>
        <p>at its most basic, time remapping is a way to change the speed a given movie clip plays in your composition. Enabling time remapping on a layer will automatically add a new attribute with two key frames to that layer, corresponding to the beginning and end of that composition’s content. Dragging the key frames closer together quickens the pace of the clip, while dragging them further apart slows it. You can also add multiple key frames to change the speed of different parts of a video. For example, adding a key frame between the two default time remapping key frames, and moving that new key frame closer to the starting keyframe will make the first half of the video play faster and the latter half play slower.</p>
        <p>Adding a loopOut() expression to a llayer’s time remapping attribute will loop that layer between those 2 key frames.</p>

        <h3 id="easing">Easing</h3>
        <p>By default, animations use a <b>linear easing function</b>, meaning that the speed of the animation is constant. </p>
        <img src="img/kb/linear.gif">
        <p>To make it so an animation is seen to accelerate from its initial value and decelerate to its end value, select two key frames, control-click the keyframes, navigate to “Keyframe Assistant" and inside that item, select one of the settings below:</p>

        <h4>"Easy Ease"</h4>
        <p>Note how the circle accelerates and decelerates.</p>
        <img src="img/kb/ease.gif">

        <h4>"Easy Ease In"</h4>
        <p>With this setting, the circle starts at speed and decellerates. This setting is good for scenarios when the viewer only sees the end of a movement.</p>
        <img src="img/kb/ease-in.gif">

        <h4>"Easy Ease Out"</h4>
        <p>With this setting, the circle accellerates and finishes at speed. This setting is good for scenarios when the viewer only sees the beginning of a movement.</p>
        <img src="img/kb/ease-out.gif">

        <p>You can also manually edit the speed graph by selecting two keyframes and clicking the "graph editor"</p>
        <img src="img/kb/graph-editor.png">
        <p>Here's the default "Easy Ease" with its speed graph:</p>
        <img src="img/kb/ease-graph.gif">
        <p>And here's a modified graph: Note how the ends of the graph have been modified so the animation takes longer to get going, and all the speed is concentrated in the middle, giving a 'snappier' movement.</p>
