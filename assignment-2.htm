        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>In this project, you will be creating an animated UI walkthrough of a web product. You can approach this project in a few ways.</p>
          <h4>a. Create something for your thesis</h4>
          <p>If your thesis project has an interactive component, feel free and use this project to develop an animated presentation of that interactive component.</p>
          <h4>b. Enhance an existing portfolio piece</h4>
          <p>If you already have have an interactive design project in your portfolio that you would like to present in motion, you are welcome to use this project to do that.</p>
          <h4>c. Start something from scratch.</h4>
          <p>If you are creating a standalone project, you can use the following prompt: You are tasked with creating a web app for a conceptual public service. This animation should do a few things:</p>
        <ol>
          <li> It should present a coherent visual identity.</li>
          <li> It should show how the app educates new users about what it is and how it works.</li>
          <li> It should document at least one primary action a user will perform through the app/service.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Say you were creating an app for a future healthcare service. You might animate a <strong>title screen</strong> that transitions to an <strong>onboarding experience</strong>. This onboarding experience might let users to swipe through a series of headlines and illustrations talking about the benefits of that service, or tap a call to action that leads directly to a <strong>signup form</strong>.</p>
        <h3>Key deliverables:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li> A summary of your product, including its purpose, the key features, and the target audience.</li>
          <li> A static design (with notes, sketches or other documentation of interaction) built with after effects importing in mind.</li>
          <li> An animation that walks through the your design on an audience-appropriate device.</li>
          <li> A considered final presentation of your motion walkthrough. You've decided who is going to use your app, but who is this presentation for? Voters? Policymakers? Funders?</li>
        </ol>
